# TaylorSeriesVisualizer

A Python toolkit for visualizing Taylor and Maclaurin series approximations alongside error analysis.

## Introduction

`TaylorSeriesVisualizer` provides an interactive and educational tool to explore and understand the concepts of Taylor and Maclaurin series. It allows users to visualize how these series approximations converge to the actual functions as the number of terms increases, and provides insights into the error associated with these approximations.

## Features

- **Function Approximation**: Approximate functions using their Taylor or Maclaurin series.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize the function and its series approximation, highlighting the convergence.
- **Error Analysis**: Calculate and display the error between the actual function and its approximation.
- **Generalization**: Works with any function for which the user can provide the derivative functions.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TaylorSeriesVisualizer.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:
```
cd TaylorSeriesVisualizer
```

Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use `TaylorSeriesVisualizer`, run the `main.py` script and follow the interactive prompts to input your function, its derivatives, the point of expansion, and the range of `x` values for visualization.

```bash
python visualizer.py
```
